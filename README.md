# SimplePage

page layout

In this project, I am laying out one page in different ways of placing elements.
This project should show my knowledge of Html+css/sass basics and understating of BEM metodology.

BlockLayout - just layout a page on block
FlexboxLayout - layout on flexbox + adding  responsive design.
GridLayout - layout on grid + using mobile first approach + scss.
